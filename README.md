# Honors Thesis – An Empirical Analysis of Gender Wage Gap in Business Sector

## Abstract

This research investigates the effect of female leadership representation on gender equality in terms of wages in the corporate sector. It specifically examines the influence of female CEO share on the gender wage gap across various industries. Utilizing data from Executive Composition, Annual Fundamentals, and the Current Population Survey, this research employs empirical analysis to examine the directions and levels of influence from female leaders.

After implementing baseline OLS, joint estimation, a mediating sequential model, and instrumental variable approaches, the findings suggest that an augmented presence of female CEOs contributes to greater gender equality in both labor wages and executive compensation.
